	◦	What are your inputs?
	         ⁃	The Different variables in each of the objects, such as the different buttons on top
	◦	What are your outputs?
	         ⁃	The changing colors, sizes, and black reset button
	◦	Who is the target audience for your project?
	         ⁃	Someone who is bored online and wants to mess around with an online etch a sketch
	◦	Where will your project be displayed?
	         ⁃	Ideally it would be on the StumbleUpon queue.
